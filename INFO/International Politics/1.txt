
Op-ed: Europe is leaving a void in a multipolar world

For most of the 21st Century, the worldâ€™s relative order has been maintained by a combination of the United States-led economic and political institutions, the rising role of China, and the counter-balancing effect of Europe, with its strong economic ties not only to the U.S. and China but also to numerous other countries and regions such as Russia and the Middle East.

However, ever since the retirement of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel nearly two years ago in December of 2021, the lack of a leading global role for Europe is increasingly felt in all regions.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine only three months later served to provide an immediate driver for greater political unity within Europe. At the same time, however, it proceeded to further isolate Europe as a political leader, not only in its relationship with Russia, but more importantly, with China and with much of the non-aligned world.

Although efforts have been made to establish a cohesive and leading role for Europe in areas such as trade, economic development, and even regional tensions such as the recently erupted Israel-Hamas conflict, the lack of a clear European leader on the international stage is creating a significant void.
